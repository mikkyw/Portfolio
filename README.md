Hello! My name is Mikayla, and I'm a junior in the University of Utah Computer Science Program, also doing the Games emphasis. Here are some of my larger projects and some short descriptions of them.

1. The Cursed Crypt - This game was a semester long effort made in my Traditional Game Development class. I had the best group of 9 talented people to work with, while I was the sole engineer of the team.
   The game spans 4 unique levels that all have their own flavor to them. The game also follows a very conscise narrative that the writers of my team created with care. My favorite part about this game is that
   I got to work with manipulating post processings effects in order to get some scary looking graphics as the game progresses. This was probably my hardest and favorite project to work on. The Cursed Crypt was made
   in Unreal Engine 5, so please build with the latest Unreal Engine version.
   
3. Return Home - This was another semester long project in my Virtual Reality class in a team of 4 people. Our project focused on creating an immersive nature experience in VR. This was the first time we had all done
   development in VR, which was a really great experience. I focused on creating the environment of the experience by making some shaders and laying out the scene, as well as doing some sound engineering. This was made
   with Unity 2021.3

4. Flappy Bunny -  This was a sole effort of mine to learn Pygame and to learn more about AI in video games. Using python's NEAT module, I created a survival of the fittest flappy bird AI simulation. I changed the art style
   to take inspiration from my favorite video game, Omori, which is why the layout looks like a bunny in space rather than a bird flying through the sky. Each bunny is a part of a neural network, where all the bunnies have a
   certain fitness score that improves as the other bunnies die. As a bunny's fitness gets higher, the better they get as survivng. This is contained in the aiflap.py file and requires both pygame and NEAT modules to run.
